I am a PhD candidate in the [Sonnenburg Lab](http://sonnenburglab.stanford.edu/) in the [Department of Microbiology and Immunology](https://microimmuno.stanford.edu/) at [Stanford University](https://www.stanford.edu), [School of Medicine](https://med.stanford.edu/)).

My research focuses primarily on characterizing (1) the gut microbiome of under-represented human populations using terabase-scale metagenome sequencing and (2) the role of bacteriophages in the human gut microbiome.  

Previously, I attended [Brigham Young University](https://www.byu.edu/) where I graduated from the [Department of Microbiology and Molecular Biology](https://mmbio.byu.edu/) (M.S and B.S). I worked on phage therapy for agricultural pathogens, from discovery and characterization of novel phages through treatment.
