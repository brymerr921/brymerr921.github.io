Hi, I'm Bryan! I'm a Bioinformatics Scientist with a passion for discovering new biology using multi-omics datasets.

My work has focused primarily on (1) unlocking host-phenotype relationships using multi-omics data, (2) discovering new microbes and natural products that are relevant for health and disease, and (3) learning whether "but it feeds your good bacteria!" is sufficient motivation to get my kids to eat their broccoli.

I'm known for contributing to a positive team environment and building successful collaborations between bench and computational researchers.

## experience

##### [Nuanced Health](https://www.nuancedhealth.com) (2022-2023) 
I worked as a Bioinformatics Scientist with an incredible team, where we harnessed robust phenotypic and multi-omics data to discover new ways to augment human health and treat disease. We (1) developed and optimized many software pipelines to maximize efficiency and data quality, tailor-fit to the experimental design, and (2) leveraged these data to identify features associated with disease and drug-response states.

##### [Stanford University](https://www.stanford.edu) (2015-2022)  
I completed my Ph.D. in the [Sonnenburg Lab](http://sonnenburglab.stanford.edu/), [Department of Microbiology and Immunology](https://microimmuno.stanford.edu/) at [Stanford University](https://www.stanford.edu) [School of Medicine](https://med.stanford.edu/). I worked on the discovery of lifestyle-associated microbes, pathogens, and bacteriophages through deep metagenome sequencing of the gut microbiome.

##### [Brigham Young University](https://www.byu.edu) (2011-2015)  
I completed my M.S. and B.S. in the Hope Lab, [Department of Microbiology and Molecular Biology](https://mmbio.byu.edu/). I worked on phage therapy for agricultural pathogens, from discovery and characterization of novel phages through treatment.
