   abstract = {Ageing is characterized by a progressive loss of physiological integrity, leading to impaired function and increased vulnerability to death1. Despite rapid advances over recent years, many of the molecular and cellular processes that underlie the progressive loss of healthy physiology are poorly understood2. To gain a better insight into these processes, here we generate a single-cell transcriptomic atlas across the lifespan of <i>Mus musculus</i> that includes data from 23 tissues and organs. We found cell-specific changes occurring across multiple cell types and organs, as well as age-related changes in the cellular composition of different organs. Using single-cell transcriptomic data, we assessed cell-type-specific manifestations of different hallmarks of ageing—such as senescence3, genomic instability4 and changes in the immune system2. This transcriptomic atlas—which we denote Tabula Muris Senis, or ‘Mouse Ageing Cell Atlas’—provides molecular information about how the most important hallmarks of ageing are reflected in a broad range of tissues and cell types.},

   abstract = {Spounavirinae viruses have received an increasing interest as tools for the control of harmful bacteria due to their relatively broad host range and strictly virulent phenotype. In this study, we collected and analyzed the complete genome sequences of 61 published phages, either ICTV-classified or candidate members of the Spounavirinae subfamily of the Myoviridae. A set of comparative analyses identified a distinct, recently proposed Bastille-like phage group within the Spounavirinae. More importantly, type 1 thymidylate synthase (TS1) and dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) genes were shown to be unique for the members of the proposed Bastille-like phage group, and are suitable as molecular markers. We also show that the members of this group encode beta-lactamase and/or sporulation-related SpoIIIE homologs, possibly questioning their suitability as biocontrol agents. We confirm the creation of a new genus--the "Bastille-like group"--in Spounavirinae, and propose that the presence of TS1- and DHFR-encoding genes could serve as signatures for the new Bastille-like group. In addition, the presence of metallo-beta-lactamase and/or SpoIIIE homologs in all members of Bastille-like group phages makes questionable their suitability for use in biocontrol.},

   abstract = {<i>Paenibacillus larvae</i> and <i>Brevibacillus laterosporus</i> are two bacteria that are members of the Paenibacillaceae family. Both are commonly found in beehives and have historically been difficult to distinguish from each other due to related genetic and phenotypic characteristics and a shared ecological niche. Here, we discuss the likely mischaracterization of three 16S rRNA sequences previously published as <i>P. larvae</i> and provide the phylogenetic evidence that supported the GenBank reassignment of the sequences as <i>B. laterosporus</i>. We explore the issues that arise by using only 16S rRNA or other single-gene analyses to distinguish between these bacteria. We also present three sets of molecular markers, two sets that distinguish <i>P. larvae</i> from <i>B. laterosporus</i> and other closely related species within the <i>Paenibacillus</i> genus and a third set that distinguishes <i>B. laterosporus</i> from <i>P. larvae</i> and other closely related species within the <i>Brevibacillus</i> genus. These molecular markers provide a tool for proper identification of these oft-mistaken species. 16S rRNA gene sequencing in bacteria has long been held as the gold standard for typing bacteria and, for the most part, is an excellent method of taxonomically identifying different bacterial species. However, the high level of 16S rRNA sequence similarity of some published strains of <i>P. larvae</i> and <i>B. laterosporus</i>, as well as possible horizontal gene transfer events within their shared ecological niche, complicates the use of 16S rRNA sequence as an effective molecular marker for differentiating these two species. Additionally, shared characteristics of these bacteria limit the effectiveness of using traditional phenotypic identification assays, such as the catalase test. The results from this study provide PCR methods to quickly differentiate between these two genera and will be useful when studying <i>Brevibacillus</i>, <i>Paenibacillus</i>, and other disease-relevant bacteria commonly found in beehives.},

   abstract = {<i>Brevibacillus laterosporus</i> is a spore-forming bacterium that causes a secondary infection in beehives following European Foulbrood disease. To better understand the contributions of <i>Brevibacillus</i> bacteriophages to the evolution of their hosts, five novel phages (Jenst, Osiris, Powder, SecTim467, and Sundance) were isolated and characterized. When compared with the five <i>Brevibacillus</i> phages currently in NCBI, these phages were assigned to clusters based on whole genome and proteome synteny. Powder and Osiris, both myoviruses, were assigned to the previously described Jimmer-like cluster. SecTim467 and Jenst, both siphoviruses, formed a novel phage cluster. Sundance, a siphovirus, was assigned as a singleton phage along with the previously isolated singleton, Emery. In addition to characterizing the basic relationships between these phages, several genomic features were observed. A motif repeated throughout phages Jenst and SecTim467 was frequently upstream of genes predicted to function in DNA replication, nucleotide metabolism, and transcription, suggesting transcriptional co-regulation. In addition, paralogous gene pairs that encode a putative transcriptional regulator were identified in four <i>Brevibacillus</i> phages. These paralogs likely evolved to bind different DNA sequences due to variation at amino acid residues predicted to bind specific nucleotides. Finally, a putative transposable element was identified in SecTim467 and Sundance that carries genes homologous to those found in <i>Brevibacillus</i> chromosomes. Remnants of this transposable element were also identified in phage Jenst. These discoveries provide a greater understanding of the diversity of phages, their behavior, and their evolutionary relationships to one another and to their host. In addition, they provide a foundation with which further <i>Brevibacillus</i> phages can be compared.},

   abstract = {<i>Brevibacillus laterosporus</i> is often present in beehives, including presence in hives infected with the causative agent of American Foulbrood (AFB), <i>Paenibacillus larvae</i>. In this work, 12 <i>B. laterosporus</i> bacteriophages induced bactericidal products in their host. Results demonstrate that <i>P. larvae</i> is susceptible to antimicrobials induced from field isolates of the bystander, <i>B. laterosporus</i>. Bystander antimicrobial activity was specific against the pathogen and not other bacterial species, indicating that the production was likely due to natural competition between the two bacteria. Three <i>B. laterosporus</i> phages were combined in a cocktail to treat AFB. Healthy hives treated with <i>B. laterosporus</i> phages experienced no difference in brood generation compared to control hives over 8 weeks. Phage presence in bee larvae after treatment rose to 60.8 ± 3.6% and dropped to 0 ± 0.8% after 72 h. In infected hives the recovery rate was 75% when treated, however AFB spores were not susceptible to the antimicrobials as evidenced by recurrence of AFB. We posit that the effectiveness of this treatment is due to the production of the bactericidal products of <i>B. laterosporus</i> when infected with phages resulting in bystander-killing of <i>P. larvae</i>. Bystander phage therapy may provide a new avenue for antibacterial production and treatment of disease.},

Three phages were selected to create a phage cocktail for the treatment of AFB infections according to the combined phages’ ability to lyse all tested strains of bacteria. Studies were performed to demonstrate the safety and efficacy of the phage cocktail treatment as a replacement for traditional antibiotics for the prevention of AFB and the treatment of active infections. Safety verification studies confirmed that the phage cocktail did not adversely affect the rate of bee death even when administered as an overdose. In a comparative study of healthy hives, traditional prophylactic antibiotic treatment experienced a 38±0.7% decrease in overall hive health, which was statistically lower than hive health observed in control hives. Hives treated with phage cocktail decreased 19±0.8%, which was not statistically different than control hives, which decreased by 10±1.0%. In a study of beehives at-risk for a natural infection, 100±0.5% of phage-treated hives were protected from AFB infection, while 80±0.5% of untreated controls became infected. AFB infected hives began with an average Hitchcock score of 2.25 out of 4 and 100±0.5% of the hives recovered completely within two weeks of treatment with phage cocktail. While the n numbers for the latter two studies are small, the results for both the phage protection rate and the phage cure rate were statistically significant (α=0.05). These studies demonstrate the powerful potential of using a phage cocktail against AFB and establish phage therapy as a feasible treatment.},

Although these small molecules commonly reach concentrations similar to those achieved by pharmaceutical agents, remarkably little is known about the microbial metabolic pathways that produce them. Here we use a combination of genetics and metabolic profiling to characterize a pathway from the gut symbiont <i>Clostridium sporogenes</i> that generates aromatic amino acid metabolites. Our results reveal that this pathway produces twelve compounds, nine of which are known to accumulate in host serum. All three aromatic amino acids (tryptophan, phenylalanine and tyrosine) serve as substrates for the pathway, and it involves branching and alternative reductases for specific intermediates. By genetically manipulating <i>C. sporogenes</i>, we modulate serum levels of these metabolites in gnotobiotic mice, and show that in turn this affects intestinal permeability and systemic immunity. This work has the potential to provide the basis of a systematic effort to engineer the molecular output of the gut bacterial community.},

   abstract = {This report includes the study of three novel bacteriophages, JL, Shanette and Basilisk, which infect the pathogen <i>B. cereus</i> and carry genes that may contribute to its pathogenesis. We analyzed host range and superinfection ability, mapped their genomes, and characterized phage structure by mass spectrometry and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The JL and Shanette genomes were 96% similar and contained 217 ORFs and 220 ORFs respectively, while Basilisk has an unrelated genome containing 138 ORFs. Mass spectrometry revealed 23 phage particle proteins for JL and 15 for Basilisk, while only 11 and four, respectively, were predicted to be present by sequence analysis. Structural protein homology to well-characterized phages predicted JL and Shanette as Myoviridiae, which was confirmed by TEM. The third phage, Basilisk, was similar to only uncharacterized phages and is an unrelated siphovirus. Cryogenic electron microscopy of this novel phage revealed a T=9 icosahedral capsid structure with the major capsid protein (MCP) likely having the same fold as bacteriophage HK97 MCP despite the lack of sequence similarity. Several putative virulence factors were encoded by these phage genomes including genes TerC and TerD for tellurium resistance. Host range analysis of all three phages supports genetic transfer of such factors within the <i>B. cereus</i> group, including <i>B. cereus</i>, <i>B. anthracis</i> and <i>B. thuringiensis</i>. The results of our study provide a basis for understanding these and other related phages as well as their contributions to the evolution and pathogenicity of <i>B. cereus</i> bacteria.
<b>IMPORTANCE</b> The <i>B. cereus</i> group of bacteria contains several human and plant pathogens, including <i>B. cereus</i>, <i>B. anthracis</i>, and <i>B. thuringiensis</i>. Phage are intimately linked to the evolution of their bacterial hosts and often provide virulence factors, making the study of <i>B. cereus</i> phages important to understanding the evolution of pathogenic strains. Herein, we provide the detailed study of three novel <i>B. cereus</i> phages, two highly related myoviruses (JL and Shanette) and an unrelated siphovirus (Basilisk). The detailed characterization of host range and superinfection, together with genomic, proteomic, and structural analysis, reveal several putative virulence factors as well as the ability of these phages to infect different pathogenic species.},

   abstract = {Gut microorganisms modulate host phenotypes and are associated with numerous health effects in humans, ranging from host responses to cancer immunotherapy to metabolic disease and obesity. However, difficulty in accurate and high-throughput functional analysis of human gut microorganisms has hindered efforts to define mechanistic connections between individual microbial strains and host phenotypes. One key way in which the gut microbiome influences host physiology is through the production of small molecules, yet progress in elucidating this chemical interplay has been hindered by limited tools calibrated to detect the products of anaerobic biochemistry in the gut. Here we construct a microbiome-focused, integrated mass-spectrometry pipeline to accelerate the identification of microbiota-dependent metabolites in diverse sample types. We report the metabolic profiles of 178 gut microorganism strains using our library of 833 metabolites. Using this metabolomics resource, we establish deviations in the relationships between phylogeny and metabolism, use machine learning to discover a previously undescribed type of metabolism in <i>Bacteroides</i>, and reveal candidate biochemical pathways using comparative genomics. Microbiota-dependent metabolites can be detected in diverse biological fluids from gnotobiotic and conventionally colonized mice and traced back to the corresponding metabolomic profiles of cultured bacteria. Collectively, our microbiome-focused metabolomics pipeline and interactive metabolomics profile explorer are a powerful tool for characterizing microorganisms and interactions between microorganisms and their host.},

Though phages are abundant in the gut, very few phages have been isolated from this ecosystem. Here, we report the genomes of 27 phages from the United States and Bangladesh that infect the prevalent human gut bacterium <i>Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron</i>. These phages are mostly distinct from previously sequenced phages with the exception of two, which are crAss-like phages. We compare these isolates to existing human gut metagenomes, revealing similarities to previously inferred phages and additional unexplored phage diversity. Finally, we use host tropisms of these phages to identify alleles of phage structural genes associated with infectivity. This work provides a detailed view of the gut's "viral dark matter" and a framework for future efforts to further integrate isolation- and sequencing-focused efforts to understand gut-resident phages.},

   abstract = {The innate immune system tightly regulates activation of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) to avoid inappropriate expression. Pathological ISG activation resulting from aberrant nucleic acid metabolism has been implicated in autoimmune disease; however, the mechanisms governing ISG suppression are unknown. Through a genome-wide genetic screen, we identified DEAD-box helicase 6 (DDX6) as a suppressor of ISGs. Genetic ablation of DDX6 induced global upregulation of ISGs and other immune genes. ISG upregulation proved cell intrinsic, imposing an antiviral state and making cells refractory to divergent families of RNA viruses. Epistatic analysis revealed that ISG activation could not be overcome by deletion of canonical RNA sensors. However, DDX6 deficiency was suppressed by disrupting LSM1, a core component of mRNA degradation machinery, suggesting that dysregulation of RNA processing underlies ISG activation in the DDX6 mutant. DDX6 is distinct among DExD/H helicases that regulate the antiviral response in its singular ability to negatively regulate immunity.},

   abstract = {The gut microbiome has been identified as a key to immune and metabolic health, especially in industrialized populations. Non-industrialized individuals harbor more diverse microbiomes and distinct bacterial lineages, but systemic under-sampling has hindered insight into the extent and functional consequences of these differences. Here, we performed ultra-deep metagenomic sequencing and laboratory strain isolation on fecal samples from the Hadza, hunter-gatherers in Tanzania, and comparative populations in Nepal and California. We recover 94,971 total genomes of bacteria, archaea, bacteriophage, and eukaryotes, and find that 43% are novel upon aggregating with existing unified datasets. Analysis of in situ growth rates, genetic pN/pS signatures, and high-resolution strain tracking reveal dynamics in the hunter-gatherer gut microbiome that are distinct from industrialized populations. Industrialized versus Hadza gut microbes are enriched in genes associated with oxidative stress, possibly a result of microbiome adaptation to inflammatory processes. We use phylogenomics to reveal that global spread of the spirochaete <i>Treponema succinifaciens</i> parallels historic human migration prior to its extinction in industrialized populations. When combined with a detailed definition of gut-resident strains that are vanishing in industrialized populations, our data demonstrate extensive perturbation in many facets of the gut microbiome brought on by the industrialized lifestyle.

<b>Recognition of work with indigenous communities</b> Research involving indigenous communities is needed for a variety of reasons including to ensure that scientific discoveries and understanding appropriately represent all populations and do not only benefit those living in industrialized nations. Special considerations must be made to ensure that this research is conducted ethically and in a non-exploitative manner. In this study we performed deep metagenomic sequencing on fecal samples that were collected from Hadza hunter-gatherers in 2013/2014 and were analyzed in previous publications using different methods. A material transfer agreement with the National Institute for Medical Research in Tanzania specifies that stool samples collected are used solely for academic purposes, permission for the study was obtained from the National Institute of Medical Research (MR/53i 100/83, NIMR/HQ/R.8a/Vol.IX/1542) and the Tanzania Commission for Science and Technology, and verbal consent was obtained from the Hadza after the study’s intent and scope was described with the help of a translator. The publications that first described these samples included several scientists and Tanzanian and Nepali field-guides as co-authors for the critical roles they played in sample collection, but as no new samples were collected in this study, only scientists who contributed to the analyses described here were included as co-authors in this publication. It is currently not possible for us to travel to Tanzania and present our results to the Hadza people, however we intend to do so once the conditions of the COVID-19 pandemic allow it.},

   abstract = {<i>Paenibacillus larvae</i> is a Firmicute bacterium that causes American Foulbrood, a lethal disease in honeybees and is a major source of global agricultural losses. Although <i>P. larvae</i> phages were isolated prior to 2013, no full genome sequences of <i>P. larvae</i> bacteriophages were published or analyzed. This report includes an in-depth analysis of the structure, genomes, and relatedness of <i>P. larvae</i> myoviruses Abouo, Davis, Emery, Jimmer1, Jimmer2, and siphovirus phiIBB_Pl23 to each other and to other known phages. <i>P. larvae</i> phages Abouo, Davies, Emery, Jimmer1, and Jimmer2 are myoviruses with ~50 kbp genomes. The six <i>P. larvae</i> phages form three distinct groups by dotplot analysis. An annotated linear genome map of these six phages displays important identifiable genes and demonstrates the relationship between phages. Sixty phage assembly or structural protein genes and 133 regulatory or other non-structural protein genes were identifiable among the six <i>P. larvae</i> phages. Jimmer1, Jimmer2, and Davies formed stable lysogens resistant to superinfection by genetically similar phages. The correlation between tape measure protein gene length and phage tail length allowed identification of co-isolated phages Emery and Abouo in electron micrographs. A Phamerator database was assembled with the <i>P. larvae</i> phage genomes and 107 genomes of Firmicute-infecting phages, including 71 <i>Bacillus</i> phages. Phamerator identified conserved domains in 1,501 of 6,181 phamilies (only 24.3%) encoded by genes in the database and revealed that <i>P. larvae</i> phage genomes shared at least one phamily with 72 of the 107 other phages. The phamily relationship of large terminase proteins was used to indicate putative DNA packaging strategies. Analyses from CoreGenes, Phamerator, and electron micrograph measurements indicated Jimmer1, Jimmer2, Abouo and Davies were related to phages phiC2, EJ-1, KC5a, and AQ113, which are small-genome myoviruses that infect <i>Streptococcus</i>, <i>Lactobacillus</i>, and <i>Clostridium</i>, respectively. This paper represents the first comparison of phage genomes in the <i>Paenibacillus</i> genus and the first organization of <i>P. larvae</i> phages based on sequence and structure. This analysis provides an important contribution to the field of bacteriophage genomics by serving as a foundation on which to build an understanding of the natural predators of <i>P. larvae</i>.},

   abstract = {<b>BACKGROUND:</b> Phage genome analysis is a rapidly growing field. Recurrent obstacles include software access and usability, as well as genome sequences that vary in sequence orientation and/or start position. Here we describe modifications to the phage comparative genomics software program, Phamerator, provide public access to the code, and include instructions for creating custom Phamerator databases. We further report genomic analysis techniques to determine phage packaging strategies and identification of the physical ends of phage genomes.
<b>RESULTS:</b> The original Phamerator code can be successfully modified and custom databases can be generated using the instructions we provide. Results of genome map comparisons within a custom database reveal obstacles in performing the comparisons if a published genome has an incorrect complementarity or an incorrect location of the first base of the genome, which are common issues in GenBank-downloaded sequence files. To address these issues, we review phage packaging strategies and provide results that demonstrate identification of the genome start location and orientation using raw sequencing data and software programs such as PAUSE and Consed to establish the location of the physical ends of the genome. These results include determination of exact direct terminal repeats (DTRs) or cohesive ends, or whether phages may use a headful packaging strategy. Phylogenetic analysis using ClustalO and phamily circles in Phamerator demonstrate that the large terminase gene can be used to identify the phage packaging strategy and thereby aide in identifying the physical ends of the genome.
</b>CONCLUSIONS:</b> Using available online code, the Phamerator program can be customized and utilized to generate databases with individually selected genomes. These databases can then provide fruitful information in the comparative analysis of phages. Researchers can identify packaging strategies and physical ends of phage genomes using raw data from high-throughput sequencing in conjunction with phylogenetic analyses of large terminase proteins and the use of custom Phamerator databases. We promote publication of phage genomes in an orientation consistent with the physical structure of the phage chromosome and provide guidance for determining this structure.},

However, the generalizable effects of antibiotics on and the contribution of environmental variables to gut commensals remain unclear. To address this, we tracked microbiota dynamics with high temporal and taxonomic resolution during antibiotic treatment in a controlled murine system by isolating variables such as diet, treatment history, and housing co-inhabitants. Human microbiotas were remarkably resilient and recovered during antibiotic treatment, with transient dominance of resistant <i>Bacteroides</i> and taxa-asymmetric diversity reduction. In certain cases, in vitro sensitivities were not predictive of in vivo responses, underscoring the significance of host and community context. A fiber-deficient diet exacerbated microbiota collapse and delayed recovery. Species replacement through cross housing after ciprofloxacin treatment established resilience to a second treatment. Single housing drastically disrupted recovery, highlighting the importance of environmental reservoirs. Our findings highlight deterministic microbiota adaptations to perturbations and the translational potential for modulating diet, sanitation, and microbiota composition during antibiotics.},

   abstract = {The ability to slow or reverse biological ageing would have major implications for mitigating disease risk and maintaining vitality. Although an increasing number of interventions show promise for rejuvenation, their effectiveness on disparate cell types across the body and the molecular pathways susceptible to rejuvenation remain largely unexplored. Here we performed single-cell RNA sequencing on 20 organs to reveal cell-type-specific responses to young and aged blood in heterochronic parabiosis. Adipose mesenchymal stromal cells, haematopoietic stem cells and hepatocytes are among those cell types that are especially responsive. On the pathway level, young blood invokes new gene sets in addition to reversing established ageing patterns, with the global rescue of genes encoding electron transport chain subunits pinpointing a prominent role of mitochondrial function in parabiosis-mediated rejuvenation. We observed an almost universal loss of gene expression with age that is largely mimicked by parabiosis: aged blood reduces global gene expression, and young blood restores it in select cell types. Together, these data lay the groundwork for a systemic understanding of the interplay between blood-borne factors and cellular integrity.},

   abstract = {A variety of cell surface structures dictate interactions between bacteria and their environment, including their viruses (bacteriophages). Members of the human gut Bacteroidetes characteristically produce several phase-variable capsular polysaccharides (CPSs), but their contributions to bacteriophage interactions are unknown. To begin to understand how CPSs have an impact on <i>Bacteroides</i>-phage interactions, we isolated 71 <i>Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron</i>-infecting bacteriophages from two locations in the United States. Using <i>B. thetaiotaomicron</i> strains that express defined subsets of CPSs, we show that CPSs dictate host tropism for these phages and that expression of non-permissive CPS variants is selected under phage predation, enabling survival. In the absence of CPSs, <i>B. thetaiotaomicron</i> escapes bacteriophage predation by altering expression of eight distinct phase-variable lipoproteins. When constitutively expressed, one of these lipoproteins promotes resistance to multiple bacteriophages. Our results reveal important roles for <i>Bacteroides</i> CPSs and other cell surface structures that allow these bacteria to persist under bacteriophage predation, and hold important implications for using bacteriophages therapeutically to target gut symbionts.},

Two distinct technical approaches were used for most organs: one approach, microfluidic droplet-based 3′-end counting, enabled the survey of thousands of cells at relatively low coverage, whereas the other, full-length transcript analysis based on fluorescence-activated cell sorting, enabled the characterization of cell types with high sensitivity and coverage.

   abstract = {Ageing is the single greatest cause of disease and death worldwide, and understanding the associated processes could vastly improve quality of life. Although major categories of ageing damage have been identified—such as altered intercellular communication, loss of proteostasis and eroded mitochondrial function—these deleterious processes interact with extraordinary complexity within and between organs, and a comprehensive, whole-organism analysis of ageing dynamics has been lacking. Here we performed bulk RNA sequencing of 17 organs and plasma proteomics at 10 ages across the lifespan of <i>Mus musculus</i>, and integrated these findings with data from the accompanying Tabula Muris Senis—or ‘Mouse Ageing Cell Atlas’—which follows on from the original Tabula Muris. We reveal linear and nonlinear shifts in gene expression during ageing, with the associated genes clustered in consistent trajectory groups with coherent biological functions—including extracellular matrix regulation, unfolded protein binding, mitochondrial function, and inflammatory and immune response. Notably, these gene sets show similar expression across tissues, differing only in the amplitude and the age of onset of expression. Widespread activation of immune cells is especially pronounced, and is first detectable in white adipose depots during middle age. Single-cell RNA sequencing confirms the accumulation of T cells and B cells in adipose tissue—including plasma cells that express immunoglobulin J—which also accrue concurrently across diverse organs. Finally, we show how gene expression shifts in distinct tissues are highly correlated with corresponding protein levels in plasma, thus potentially contributing to the ageing of the systemic circulation. Together, these data demonstrate a similar yet asynchronous inter- and intra-organ progression of ageing, providing a foundation from which to track systemic sources of declining health at old age.},

Here, we assess the resilience of the gut ecosystem to osmotic perturbation at multiple length and timescales using mice as model hosts. Osmotic stress caused reproducible extinction of highly abundant taxa and expansion of less prevalent members in human and mouse microbiotas. Quantitative imaging revealed decimation of the mucus barrier during osmotic perturbation, followed by recovery. The immune system exhibited temporary changes in cytokine levels and a lasting IgG response against commensal bacteria. Increased osmolality prevented growth of commensal strains in vitro, revealing one mechanism contributing to extinction. Environmental availability of microbiota members mitigated extinction events, demonstrating how species reintroduction can affect community resilience. Our findings (1) demonstrate that even mild osmotic diarrhea can cause lasting changes to the microbiota and host and (2) lay the foundation for interventions that increase system-wide resilience.},

Here, we determined how two microbiota-targeted dietary interventions, plant-based fiber and fermented foods, influence the human microbiome and immune system in healthy adults. Using a 17-week randomized, prospective study (n = 18/arm) combined with -omics measurements of microbiome and host, including extensive immune profiling, we found diet-specific effects. The high-fiber diet increased microbiome-encoded glycan-degrading carbohydrate active enzymes (CAZymes) despite stable microbial community diversity. Although cytokine response score (primary outcome) was unchanged, three distinct immunological trajectories in high-fiber consumers corresponded to baseline microbiota diversity. Alternatively, the high-fermented-food diet steadily increased microbiota diversity and decreased inflammatory markers. The data highlight how coupling dietary interventions to deep and longitudinal immune and microbiome profiling can provide individualized and population-wide insight. Fermented foods may be valuable in countering the decreased microbiome diversity and increased inflammation pervasive in industrialized society.},

In contrast, relatively few lab mouse-associated bacteria have been isolated, despite the fact that the overwhelming number of studies on the microbiota use laboratory mice that are colonized with microbes that are quite distinct from those in humans. Gut inflammation directly impacts the growth and stability of commensal gut microbes and can lead to long-lasting changes in microbiota composition that can prolong or exacerbate disease states. While mouse models are used extensively to investigate the interplay between microbes and the inflamed state, the paucity of cultured mouse gut microbes has hindered efforts to determine causal relationships. To address this issue, we are assembling the Collection of Inflammation-Associated Mouse Intestinal Bacteria (CIAMIB). The initial release of this collection comprises 41 isolates of 39 unique bacterial species, covering 4 phyla and containing 10 previously uncultivated isolates, including 1 novel family and 7 novel genera. The collection significantly expands the number of available Muribaculaceae, Lachnospiraceae, and Coriobacteriaceae isolates and includes microbes from genera associated with inflammation, such as <i>Prevotella</i> and <i>Klebsiella</i>. We characterized the growth of CIAMIB isolates across a diverse range of nutritional conditions and predicted their metabolic potential and anaerobic fermentation capacity based on the genomes of these isolates. We also provide the first metabolic analysis of species within the genus <i>Adlercreutzia</i>, revealing these representatives to be nitrate-reducing and severely restricted in their ability to grow on carbohydrates. CIAMIB isolates are fully sequenced and available to the scientific community as a powerful tool to study host-microbiota interactions.
<b>IMPORTANCE</b> Attempts to explore the role of the microbiota in animal physiology have resulted in large-scale efforts to cultivate the thousands of microbes that are associated with humans. In contrast, relatively few lab mouse-associated bacteria have been isolated, despite the fact that the overwhelming number of studies on the microbiota use laboratory mice that are colonized with microbes that are quite distinct from those in humans. Here, we report the results of a large-scale isolation of bacteria from the intestines of laboratory mice either prone to or suffering from gut inflammation. This collection comprises dozens of novel isolates, many of which represent the only cultured representatives of their genus or species. We report their basic growth characteristics and genomes and are making them widely available to the greater research community.},
